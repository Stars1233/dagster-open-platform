# Opportunity Win Probability Model

## Overview
The Opportunity Win Probability Model is a data science model that predicts the likelihood of winning sales opportunities. It leverages historical opportunity data, account information, and various sales metrics to generate probability estimates.

## Data Sources
The model uses several key data sources:

1. **Salesforce Opportunities**
   - Opportunity details (ID, name, amount, stage)
   - Probability estimates
   - Close dates
   - Stage history
   - Forecast categories
   - Risk factors

2. **Account Information**
   - Account details
   - Target account status
   - Account source
   - First day as target account

3. **Sales Activities**
   - Sales Accepted Lead (SAL) dates
   - Meeting dates (intro, discovery, evaluation, proposal)
   - Campaign attribution
   - Sales cycle stages

4. **Risk Factors**
   - Budget risks
   - Timeline risks
   - Competition risks
   - Technical risks
   - Stakeholder risks
   - Resource risks
   - Process risks

## Key Features
The model considers various features including:

- **Opportunity Characteristics**
  - Stage in sales cycle
  - Opportunity type (new business vs. expansion)
  - Amount and ARR
  - Close date
  - Probability estimates
  - Forecast category

- **Account Characteristics**
  - Target account status
  - Account source
  - First opportunity status
  - ABM influence

- **Sales Process Metrics**
  - Time in each stage
  - SAL to close duration
  - Meeting progression
  - Campaign influence

- **Risk Indicators**
  - Budget constraints
  - Timeline pressures
  - Competition presence
  - Technical requirements
  - Stakeholder alignment
  - Resource availability
  - Process complexity

## Model Outputs
The model provides:

1. **Win Probability Estimates**
   - Percentage likelihood of winning the opportunity (0-100%)
   - Confidence intervals showing the range of possible outcomes
   - Historical accuracy metrics comparing predictions to actual results
   - Trend analysis showing how probability has changed over time
   - Stage-specific probability adjustments based on historical conversion rates

2. **Risk Assessments**
   - Identified risk factors with detailed descriptions
   - Risk severity scoring (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Mitigation recommendations for each identified risk
   - Risk impact analysis on win probability
   - Risk trend monitoring over time
   - Risk category breakdown (budget, timeline, competition, etc.)

3. **Forecast Categories**
   - Best case: Optimistic scenario with all risks mitigated
   - Most likely: Realistic scenario based on current data
   - Commit: Conservative estimate with high confidence
   - Pipeline: Early-stage opportunities requiring more qualification
   - Category confidence scores
   - Historical accuracy by forecast category

4. **Actionable Insights**
   - Key drivers of win probability
   - Recommended next steps for sales teams
   - Critical milestones to focus on
   - Deal acceleration opportunities
   - Resource allocation recommendations
   - Competitor analysis insights

5. **Performance Metrics**

   - Average deal velocity
   - Win rate by segment
   - Forecast accuracy
   - Risk prediction accuracy
